    2. For Analysis with Pivot Tables
    3. For Visualization using Charts
  
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and Preparation, we perform the following actions
-    Data Loading and Inspection
-    Data Cleaning and Formatting (Duplicates removed, categories standardized)
-    Included additional columns needed for more analysis (Price_Bucket, Discount_Interval, Potential_Revenue,Ratingg Bin)

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Below is a summary of the analysis for the 14 tasks given. Each task’s methodology and output are condensed for clarity, with their individual pivot tables;
 
  1. Average Discount Percentage by Category
     - Method: Pivot table grouping by category, averaging discount_percentage.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = discount_percentage (Average).
     - Output:
  
  2. Number of Products per Category
     - Method: Count unique product_name per category using a pivot table.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = product_name (Count).
     - Output:

  3. Total Number of Reviews per Category
     - Method: Sum rating_count per category.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = rating_count (Sum).
     - Output:
    
  4. Products with Highest Average Ratings
     - Method: Sort by rating (descending), filter for rating_count ≥ 50.
     - Excel: Sort rating column, filter rating_count ≥ 50, display top 10.
     - Output:

  5. Average Actual vs. Discounted Price by Category
     - Method: Pivot table averaging actual_price and discounted_price by category.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = actual_price (Average), discounted_price (Average).
     - Output:

  6. Products with Highest Number of Reviews
     - Method: Sort by rating_count (descending), display top 10.
     - Excel:Sort rating_count column, display top 10 with product_name, category, rating_count.
     - Output:

  7. Number of Products with Discount ≥50%
     - Method: Filter discount_percentage ≥ 50, count rows.
     - Excel Filter: discount_percentage ≥ 50, count rows.
     - Output

  8. Distribution of Product Ratings
     - Method: Rating bin, count products per bin.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = Rating bin, Values = product_name (Count).
     - Output:

  9. Total Potential Revenue by Category
     - Method: Calculate potential_revenue = actual_price * rating_count, sum by category.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = potential_revenue (Sum).
     - Output:

 10. Number of Unique Products per Price Range Bucket
     - Method: Bin actual_price into <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500, count unique product_name.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = Price_Bucket, Values = product_name (Count).
     - Output:

 11. Rating vs. Discount Level
     - Method: Bin discount_percentage into 0–10%, 10–20%, etc., calculate average rating.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = Discount_Interval, Values = rating (Average), product_name (Count).
     - Output:

 12. Products with <1,000 Reviews
     - Method: Filter rating_count < 1,000, count rows.
     - Output:

 13. Categories with Highest Discounts
     - Method: Pivot table with max discount_percentage per category.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = category, Values = discount_percentage (Max).
     - Output:

 14. Top 5 Products by Rating and Reviews
     - Method: Calculate Composite_Score = 0.6*rating + 0.4*log(rating_count), sort top 5.
     - Excel Pivot: Rows = product_name, category, Values = Composite_Score (Average), sort top 5.
     - Output:
    
### Data Analysis
