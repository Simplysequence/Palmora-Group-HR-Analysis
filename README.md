### Project Overview
---
Based on the case scenario, I will outline a structured approach to analyze the Palmoria Group's HR data, focusing on gender-related issues, and address the specific requirements and questions posed. I will also provide a visualization, and calculations for the bonus payments.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of data used contains information from Palmora Group.

### Tools Used
---
-  Power BI [Download Here]([https://www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494))
    1. For Data Cleaning and preparation
    2. For Analysis
    3. For Visualization using Charts in Power BI environment
  
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and Preparation, we perform the following actions
-    Data Loading and Inspection
-    Data Cleaning and Formatting (Duplicates removed, categories standardized)
-    Included additional columns needed for more analysis.
-    Columns for employees who did not indicate their gender was assigned as "Anonymous"
-    Employees without Salary structure was taken out.
-    Departments with "NULL" was taken out as well.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Below is a summary of the analysis for the tasks given. Each task’s methodology and output are condensed for clarity, with their individual charts;
 
    1. Gender Distribution in the Organization
     - Objective: Determine the gender distribution overall, by region, and by department.
 
     - Overall Gender Distribution By Region:

     - Overall Gender Distribution By Department:
 ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b263a373-d8e2-4df8-a7b2-60809ca332cb)


Insight: From the chart above it is clearly indicated that departments such as Product Management, Legal and Accounting are heavily male-dominated, this could indicate occupational segregation, contributing to gender inequality perceptions. I would Suggest that Management should focus on diversifying hiring in these departments.

    2. Insights on Ratings Based on Gender
    - Objective: Analyze performance ratings by gender to identify potential biases

    - Distribution of Performance Ratings by Gender

Insight: From the chart above, Males receive higher ratings in departments such as Legal, Product Managemnt and Support. This may suggest bias in performance evaluations, especially in male-dominated areas. Managemnt should review rating criteria and ensure standardized, objective evaluation processes.

    3. Salary Structure and Gender Pay Gap
    - Objective: Analyze the salary structure to identify the gender pay gap and pinpoint departments and regions for management

    
    -  Gender Pay Gap by Department
  ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e0062b-25cd-41de-9efa-857c4a3d169c)

Key findings: Departments with Larger Pay Gaps such as Business Development and Engineering should be prioritized for Salary audits and adjustments.

Insights: The Gender pay gap exists particularly in male-dominated departments. Management should conduct a detailed pay equity analysis, focusing on the male-dominated departments and consider factors like job roles, experience and hours worked to address disperities.



    4. Minimum Salary Regulation($90,000)
        - Objective: Assess compliance with the $90,000 minimum salary regulation and analyze Salary distribution
        - Salary Regulation Bands by Gender

<img width="794" height="575" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f3cf91-4d38-4d70-8108-0ccc4a48314c" />

 Insights: Palmora Group does not meet the $90,000 minimum salary regulation for most employees. Management must prioritize salary adjustments, starting with lower-paid employees and assess the financial impact of compliance.


    5. Bonus Payment Allocation
        - Objective: Calculate bonus payments based performance ratings, total compensation(Salary + Bonus) and aggregate payoiuts by region and company-wide.
        - Total Bonus payouts by Region, with a company-wide total.
  
![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0f6a44-6a69-41fb-a384-b26454a490f7)

 Insights: Bonus Payments amplify existing salary disparities if tied to performance ratings, especially if males receive higher ratings. Management should ensure equitable bonus distribution and consider flat bonuses for lower-paid employees ro address the minimum salary gap.

### Recommendations for Management
1. Address Ocupational Segregation: Managemnt should implement targeted hiring and training programs to increase female representation in male-dominated departments

2. Conduct Pay Equity Audit: Managemnt should focus on departments with significant pay gaps such as Business Development, Services, Engineering, Human Resources and Research Development. Adjust salaries to     close the gap, prioritizing roles with comparable responsibilities.

3. Ensure Compliance with Minimum Salary Regulations: Management should develop a phased plan to raise salaries to meet the $90,000 minimum, starting with employees in the lowest salary bands. Assess budget     impacts and explore cost-saving measures elsewhere.
    
4. STandardize Performance Evaluation: Management should implement objective, transparent criteria for performance ratings to eliminate potential gender bias, particularly in male-dominated departments.

5. Enhance Pay Transparency: Management should publish internal gender pay gap reports and action plans, as suggested by Mr. Victor Friday Archibong, to build trust and demonstrate commitment to equality.

6. Equitable Bonus Structure: Management should consider hybrid bonus models (e.g Flat bonuses for lower-paid employees, performance-based for higher-paid) to reduce disparities amplified by performance              ratings.

### Conclusion
Palmora Group faces significant gender inequality challenges, including a gender pay gap, potential bias in performance ratings, and non-compliance with the $90,000 minimum salary regulation. By focusing on occupational segregation, pay equity and transparent evaluation processes, management can address these issues and improve the company’s reputation as it plans to scale. The visualizations and recommendations provided will help Mr. Shofoluwe and the CEO, Mr. Chukwuma, take immediate action to promote gender equality and mitigate negative media perceptions.
